RAAT is a system that allows you to automatically evaluate the level of text reading attention. Write or paste text in any language through Editor, enter the e-mail addresses of the readers, and click "Send". They will immediately get a link to personalized text with generated errors. Each wrong word needs to be tapped twice, at the end "Commit" is to be tapped and the reader will get a score of 1 (unsufficeint) - 5 (excellent).

Default build is iOS.
Becouse off the facebook plugin bug you need to comment/uncomment block in pubspec.yaml  for Android build.
